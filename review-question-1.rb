# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
pokemon[0][:abilities][0][:ability][:url]
# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
pokemon.find { |pokemon| pokemon[:base_experience] > 40 }
# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
pokemon.select { |pokemon| pokemon[:base_experience] > 40 }
# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
pokemon.map { |pokemon| pokemon[:name] }
# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
pokemon.each do |pokemon| 
    if pokemon[:weight] > 60
        true
    else
        false
    end
end
#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
